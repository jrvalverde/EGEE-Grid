Remote work directory in the {\bf Grid}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classGrid})} UI server. 

We will use this to separate different services into alternate hierarchies in the grid server, as well as to avoid cluttering the remote user's dir with too many directories.

This should be a path relative to the user home OR an actual correct full path. For the sake of versatility it is better to use a relative path.
