\subsection{Detailed Description}
ssh.php -- a class to execute remote commands over SSH 

This file contains the files-based implementation of the SExec class. This implementation relies on the usage of regular temporary files to communicate with the remote end, thus avoiding several drawbacks (mainly deadlocks) associated with pipes.

The SExec class provides methods to launch and control jobs and transfer files over SSH.

PHP versions 4 and 5
