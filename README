This directory contains Web-based Grid developments at EMBnet/CNB

All projects are/should be managed using CVS.

CVS at EMBnet/CNB has several repositories devoted to various goals:
	root	- generic / system administration
	bioinfo	- Bioinformatic tools
	egee	- EGEE Grid developments
All of them are located on a shared disk that is NFS mounted in all
systems so it may be accessed locally.

For projects maintained in this directory we will use the EGEE CVS
repository, whose CVSROOT is at /data/cvs/egee

	export CVSROOT=/data/cvs/egee

	setenv CVSROOT /data/cvs/egee

To work on a project:

	cvs co -P project

Do your changes, then run off the documentation

	cd doc ; ./makedoc.sh ; cd ..

 and finally

	cvs ci project

	cvs release project

see cvs(1) for more info.
