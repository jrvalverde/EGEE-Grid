/**
 *  GROCK - GRid dOCK
 *
 *  A program to perform high-thoughput docking on the Grid.
 *
 *  The goal of this program is to provide a convenient way to generate
 * docking searches of a probe molecule against a database of target
 * molecules.
 *
 *  The probe may be a protein or a drug or small compound. The target
 * database to be searched may be a set of protein or small compound
 * structures.

/**
 *  Grock
 *
 *  Will work on the current directory
 *
 *  Expects:
 * -  	a probe molecule named 'probe.pdb' in the CWD
 * -	a series of parameters in a file named 'options'
 *
 *  The 'options' file must be in the current directory, and contain
 * a series of option=value pairs, one on each line, divided in
 * two sections:
 * - first comes the authorization section containing details needed
 * to log in and activate the grid
 * - an empty line separates both sections
 * - last come the program actual options: which database to search,
 * docker to use and dosck-specific parameters.
 *
 *  See processor.php for more details.
 *
 *  Once the options have been processed the file is deleted. NOTE that
 * since the 'options' file contains user authentication data, it should
 * be readable only by the user running GROCK and is anyway very sensitive.
 * For this reason, processor.php uses a pipe instead of an actual file,
 * and GROCK deletes the file as soon as it is done.
 *
 *  We might do without a file getting all in the command line, but this
 * would be much worst as any user would then access the auth info by
 * issuing a ps(1) while grock is running.
 *
 *  We might read from stdin but then we would have a problem running in
 * the background from PHP (sic).
 *
 *  After all options have been processed we call grock_submit() to
 * generate all the jobs needed (one per database entry) and submit
 * them to the Grid.
 *
 *  Once the jobs have been sent, we enter a timed loop to collect the
 * job output. If we can not collect all job output back before the
 * predefined timeout, unfinished jobs will be ignored.
 *
 *  Each iteration we'll reap all finished jobs output and recompute the
 * sorted list of best scores so the user may follow the progression of 
 * the search on the fly.
 *
 *  GROCK will generate a number of directories and files in the current
 * directory. Since these may be way too many, it is advisable to run
 * GROCK in a separate directory that is empty except for the 'probe.pdb'
 * and 'options' file to start with.
 *
 *  In the initial phase, GROCK will generate a directory for each docking job
 * to be submitted, i.e. one for each target molecule in the database, named
 * after the target entry name. Each directory will contain all the material
 * related to docking the probe and target molecules.
 *
 *  Additionally GROCK will generate a listing of target molecules being
 * explored, a status file to state the processing step it is at, and two
 * auxiliary trace files, one for normal output and a second for 'error'
 * or 'abnormal' output, which may be helpful in case of need to diagnose
 * a failure.
