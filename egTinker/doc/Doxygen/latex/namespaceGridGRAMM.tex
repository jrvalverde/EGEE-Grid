PHP-MIDDLEWARE INTERACTION.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
PHP-MIDDLEWARE INTERACTION. 

This php script runs in the local machine as user 'apache', is the 'father' process. In a remote machine (our grid User Interface) we open a 'child' process, and it's runs as the user validated before. That user must connect via ssh to the User Interface without password See {\tt http://www.cs.umd.edu/$\sim$arun/misc/ssh.html} and {\tt http://www.openssh.com/} Remember that the User Interface has mounted a directory in the local machine
