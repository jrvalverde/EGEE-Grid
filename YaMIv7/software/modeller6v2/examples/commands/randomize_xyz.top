# Example for: RANDOMIZE_XYZ

# This will randomize the X,Y,Z of the model:

READ_MODEL FILE = '1fas'

# Change existing X,Y,Z for +- 4 angstroms:
RANDOMIZE_XYZ DEVIATION = 4.0
WRITE_MODEL FILE = '1fas.ini1'

# Assign X,Y,Z in the range from -100 to 100 angstroms:
RANDOMIZE_XYZ DEVIATION = -100.0
WRITE_MODEL FILE = '1fas.ini2'
