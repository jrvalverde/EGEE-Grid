# Example for: RENAME_SEGMENTS

# This will assign new PDB single-character chain id's to all the chains
# in the input PDB file (here there are two 'chains': protein and the HETATM
# water molecules).

# Read the MODEL with all HETATM and water records (so there are two 'chains'):
READ_MODEL FILE = '1fas', HETATM_IO = on, WATER_IO = on
# Assign new segment names and write out the new model:
RENAME_SEGMENTS SEGMENT_IDS = 'X' 'Y'
WRITE_MODEL FILE = '1fas.ini'
