# Example for: MAKE_TOPOLOGY_MODEL, WRITE_TOPOLOGY_MODEL

# This creates a topology library for heavy atoms from the 
# CHARMM all-atom topology library:

# Read CHARMM all-atom topology library:
READ_TOPOLOGY FILE = '${LIB}/top.lib'

# Keep only heavy atoms (TOPOLOGY_MODEL = 3)
MAKE_TOPOLOGY_MODEL TOPOLOGY_MODEL = 3

# Write the resulting topology library to a new file:
WRITE_TOPOLOGY_MODEL FILE = 'top_heav.lib'
