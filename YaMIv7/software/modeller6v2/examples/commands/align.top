# Example for: ALIGN

# This will read two sequences, align them, and write the alignment
# to a file:

SET OUTPUT_CONTROL = 1 1 1 1 1

READ_ALIGNMENT FILE = 'toxin.ali', ALIGN_CODES = '1fas' '2ctx'
# The as1.sim.mat similarity matrix is used by default:
ALIGN GAP_PENALTIES_1D = -600 -400
WRITE_ALIGNMENT FILE = 'toxin-seq.ali'
