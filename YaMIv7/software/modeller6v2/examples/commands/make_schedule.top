# Example for: MAKE_SCHEDULE, WRITE_SCHEDULE, READ_SCHEDULE

# This will create an VTFM optimization schedule for a model 
# and write it to a file.

# MODEL has to be in memory for MAKE_SCHEDULE:
READ_MODEL FILE = '1fas'
MAKE_SCHEDULE LIBRARY_SCHEDULE = 1
# Write the schedule to a file:
WRITE_SCHEDULE FILE = '1fas.sch'
# Read it in just for fun:
READ_SCHEDULE FILE = '1fas.sch'
