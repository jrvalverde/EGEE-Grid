** PLATFORMS

  MODELLER is written in Fortran 90 and runs on Silicon Graphics under IRIX,
  on Sun workstation under Solaris, IBM under AIX, on DEC Alphas and Pentium
  PC's under Linux.



** INSTALLATION

  See file modeller.README for information about how to get MODELLER. The
  source code is not generally available. Hence, most users are limited to
  the compiled versions of MODELLER. Program is distributed as a single
  compressed tar archive (modeller6v2.tar.Z) that contains scripts,
  libraries, examples, documentation (in PDF and HTML formats) and 
  executables for different platforms and operating systems.


   1)  Download modeller6v2.tar.Z file into the desired directory
       on your computer.


   2)  Unpack the file:     

          uncompress modeller6v2.tar.Z     
          tar xvf modeller6v2.tar  

      The result of unpacking will be directory ./modeller6v2 
      (next to the  modeller6v2.tar.Z file) with the following 
      uncompressed files and  directories:

         doc/             MODELLER documentation directory
         examples/        directory containing examples and tutorials
         Install          installation script          
         INSTALLATION     this file
         modeller.README  file describing distribution and registration
         modlib/          libraries and data files for the program
         scripts/         script files used to compile and use MODELLER
         src/             directory with executables


   3)  Go to the ./modeller6v2 directory and run the installation script 

         ./Install 

       Answer several questions as prompted. If you make a mistake, 
       you can re-run the script.


   4)  If the script installation was successful you may stop here. 
    Otherwise you have to install MODELLER manually as described 
    below.


5)  Include into your login script the lines below. Edit them 
    appropriately to suit your system. In case of csh or tcsh 
    the login script is ".cshrc" (you can generally find your 
    current shell by typing 'echo $shell').
