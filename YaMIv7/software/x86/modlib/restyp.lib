#
#
# Several residue naming schemes exist: 
# 
#   (1) Three-letter Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, extended.
#   (2) Single-letter Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, extended.
#   (3) Four letter CHARMM, extended.
# 
# 
# This file gives:
# 
#   (1) The residue names in those three sets.
#   (2) Equivalences between the three sets.
# 
# Each residue type may have several PDB-3 names, but only one PDB-1 
# name and one CHARMM name. The naming schemes are case sensitive. If
# a certain existing CHARMM residue type does not have an equivalent 
# in the PDB-1/3 lists, its name is invented, or the name of a similar 
# residue is used. In contrast, if an existing PDB residue type does 
# not occur in the CHARMM list, its name is kept undefined (####) 
# so that the lack of the CHARMM topology entry is properly flagged. 
# This means that a certain residue's name may appear several times 
# within the same scheme (for example, CHARMM charged and neutral
# species are not distinguished in the PDB list).
